# FeedPicker: A Feedback Tool with AI Integration
In 2013, West Java had more than 9,042,519 Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) according to the Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), outnumbering large enterprises by 1,853 units, with over 50% of the national industry located in the region. The ratio of MSME-to-large enterprise contribution to the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) of West Java stood at 55:45, underscoring the pivotal role of MSMEs in the regional economy. However, the sheer quantity of MSMEs in West Java doesn't necessarily translate to optimal income levels, as many lack effective promotional tools and platforms for customer feedback. Moreover, there's a deficiency in forums for MSMEs to share information about leveraging technology to enhance business profitability.

Aligned with this positive trajectory, we proudly introduce **FeedPicker**, a strategic initiative to develop an all-encompassing feedback platform for MSME customers. This move is prompted not just by the imperative to sustain customer loyalty but also as a promising investment prospect for empowering MSMEs further. FeedPicker, designed in response to the burgeoning number of MSMEs in Indonesia, not only acts as a conduit for customer opinions but also as a strategic self-assessment tool for MSMEs.
